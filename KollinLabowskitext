Chapter 22 - Bardi's Abiding With Gudmund.

So Eyolf dights him for the journey, and goes with five-and- twenty horses to meet them, and happens on them on Galmastrand. He greets them well, and bids them go home with him, by the will of his father.

They did so, and there they had to themselves the second bench throughout the winter; and Gudmund was cheery to them, and did to them after the fashion of a great man and well. And that was widely rumoured.

Einar, the son of Jarnskeggi, often bids them go to his house and stay with him. And thus now they are right happy.

Now we have to bring to mind, that it was Thorarin's rede that with Bardi there were men who were of great worth and had much to fall back upon. And they now sent to the west for their moneys, being still bent on faring abroad in the summer.

Chapter 23 - Eric's Song On The Heathslayings.

Some time that winter it befell that there was one who asked Eric the Skald as to what had befallen, and how many lives had been lost. He sang:


	"Famed groves of the race-course whereon the sword runneth,
	All up on the Heath 'twas eleven lay dead
	In the place where the lime-board, the red board of battle,
	Went shivering to pieces midst din of the shields.
	And thereof was the cause of the battle, that erewhile
	It was Gisli fell in with his fate and his ending
	In the midst of the fray of the fire of the fight:
	'Gainst the wielder of wound-shaft we thrust forth the onslaught."
